The Plant Soil Moisture Monitor is designed to help maintain optimal soil moisture levels for plants. By using the ESP32 microcontroller and a capacitive soil moisture sensor, the device reads real-time moisture levels, making it ideal for indoor and outdoor plants that require regular monitoring.

**Features**
Real-Time Moisture Monitoring: Continuously checks soil moisture levels.
Alerts and Notifications: (Optional) Sends alerts via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi when soil moisture is low.
Low-Power Mode: Configured for low power consumption to extend battery life if used with portable power sources.
Easy Setup: Simple hardware connections and a user-friendly code structure for beginners and advanced users.

**Components**
ESP32 Microcontroller: Handles sensor data, processing, and (optional) communication.
Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor: Measures soil moisture without corroding, unlike resistive sensors.
Power Source: USB or battery power (if portable).
(Optional) Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Module: Use the ESP32â€™s built-in module to send notifications.
